# Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 2

## Data Wrangling (WeRateDogs)

This data wrangling and exploratory data analysis project is one of the projects in the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree course.
It is a an intermediate data wrangling project aimed at gathering, cleaning (wrangling), analysing and visualizing the [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs) dataset to gain some insights, and also present those insights graphically.

## Preview

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) which rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dogs.

The actual wrangling, exploratory analysis and visualization efforts are contained in the `wrangle_act.ipynb` file. To preview, open the file in a `Jupyter Notebook`.
